## Overview  
Patient AI is a **virtual patient chatbot** designed to help **medical students practice patient-doctor conversations** in a safe, controlled, and private environment.  

The project allows students to upload **past patient histories (PDFs)**, which are stored in a **local vector database**. Students can then interact with the AI in a **realistic patient roleplay**, asking questions and receiving responses that are **context-aware** and based on the uploaded documents.  

🚫 **No data breaches** – The system runs entirely **offline and locally**, with **no external API calls**.  

---

## Project Goals  
- ✅ **Step 1:** Develop an English-based chatbot (achieved).  
- 🚧 **Step 2:** Extend support to **regional languages** (next target: Hindi).  
   - Students will type in **Hinglish** (e.g., "aapko kab se bukhar hai?").  
   - AI will respond in **strict Devanagari Hindi**.  
- 🔮 **Future Roadmap:**  
   - Build a **Streamlit UI** for a smooth end-to-end app experience.  
   - Implement **student login and session tracking**.  
   - Add an **LLM Judge** that evaluates and scores medical students based on their questioning skills.  
   - Expand to multiple regional languages.  

---

## Features  
- 📂 **PDF Upload** – Import patient histories as training context.  
- 🧠 **Vector Database (FAISS)** – Efficient storage & retrieval of medical history.  
- 🗣️ **Conversational AI** – Acts as the patient in a roleplay scenario.  
- 🌐 **Language Expansion** – English now, Hindi and others in the pipeline.  
- 🛡️ **Local Setup** – No internet or external API calls required.

## Tech Stack  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) – Interactive UI  
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) – Orchestration & retrieval chains  
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) – Local LLM & embeddings  
- [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/) – Vector store for document embeddings  
- [PDFPlumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) – PDF document loader  

---

## Current Workflow  
1. Medical student uploads a **PDF patient history**.  
2. Document is **split into chunks** and stored in a **vector database (FAISS)**.  
3. Student starts a **chat session**.  
4. AI **acts as the patient** and answers only based on the given context.  
5. Chat history is also stored in the vector DB for **better continuity**.

## Future Vision
- Practice patient interaction in multiple languages.
- Get evaluated and scored by an AI judge.
- Maintain sessions & progress history.
- Train in a secure offline environment without risking patient data.

## Why This Project Matters
- Helps medical students practice clinical questioning in a safe way.
- Provides a realistic simulation of patient interactions.
- Maintains patient confidentiality – no data leaves the local machine.
