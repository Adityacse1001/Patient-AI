6,"A 45-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of a painful, swollen, and red lesion on his right ankle, which he initially described as a ""rash"" but clarified as more painful than rash-like. The patient reports the lesion appeared approximately one week ago, with pain developing yesterday. He describes the area as swollen, increasingly red, and ""meaner"" in appearance. He notes the presence of scabs, which he admits to scratching, and one of these scabs has since opened, leaking a ""white stuff"" (suggestive of purulent discharge) since the swelling began. The pain is exacerbated by walking and flexing the ankle but is relieved at rest. He reports feeling ""hot"" for the past 12 hours, and subjectively notes his right leg feels hotter than his left. He has also experienced a general feeling of being ""crummy"" for the last couple of weeks, with decreased energy today, increased hunger, and tiredness, which he attributes to stress and potentially poorly controlled diabetes. He denies difficulty breathing or chest pain. While he has a history of occasional diabetic ulcers and minor foot trauma due to poor foot care, he states this specific presentation is ""strange looking"" and unlike anything he has experienced before, though he does have a currently ""doing alright"" ulcer on his left heel. His past medical history is significant for poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, with a last known A1C of approximately 9, for which he takes three oral medications (including Metformin and an unnamed ""Sidas...something""), but is not on insulin and has stopped regularly monitoring his blood sugars. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, for which he takes Rosuvastatin, childhood asthma (currently asymptomatic), and chronic back pain for 10 years managed with Tylenol and Advil. He reports decreased sensation in his feet over the years but notes only a dull ache in the affected ankle area. He has a known penicillin allergy, manifesting as facial bloating and difficulty breathing as a child. His surgical history includes sinus surgery in his teens for sinusitis. Socially, he is a 45-year-old unemployed accountant, partially self-employed, living in town and seeing his children every two weeks. He smokes occasionally, increasing to approximately two packs per week recently due to stress, and consumes alcohol, averaging a 24-pack of beer per weekend, primarily on those days. Family history reveals a strong maternal predisposition to diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, while his paternal side is generally healthy, with one aunt having lung cancer, who was a heavy smoker.","नमस्ते, तो मैं समझ रहा हूँ कि आपके पैर पर रैश (khujli/laali) है।","नमस्ते डॉक्टर साहब, मैं 45 साल का पुरुष हूँ, मुझे अपने पैर पर एक पुराने दाने को लेकर चिंता हो रही है।"

6,"A 45-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of a painful, swollen, and red lesion on his right ankle, which he initially described as a ""rash"" but clarified as more painful than rash-like. The patient reports the lesion appeared approximately one week ago, with pain developing yesterday. He describes the area as swollen, increasingly red, and ""meaner"" in appearance. He notes the presence of scabs, which he admits to scratching, and one of these scabs has since opened, leaking a ""white stuff"" (suggestive of purulent discharge) since the swelling began. The pain is exacerbated by walking and flexing the ankle but is relieved at rest. He reports feeling ""hot"" for the past 12 hours, and subjectively notes his right leg feels hotter than his left. He has also experienced a general feeling of being ""crummy"" for the last couple of weeks, with decreased energy today, increased hunger, and tiredness, which he attributes to stress and potentially poorly controlled diabetes. He denies difficulty breathing or chest pain. While he has a history of occasional diabetic ulcers and minor foot trauma due to poor foot care, he states this specific presentation is ""strange looking"" and unlike anything he has experienced before, though he does have a currently ""doing alright"" ulcer on his left heel. His past medical history is significant for poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, with a last known A1C of approximately 9, for which he takes three oral medications (including Metformin and an unnamed ""Sidas...something""), but is not on insulin and has stopped regularly monitoring his blood sugars. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, for which he takes Rosuvastatin, childhood asthma (currently asymptomatic), and chronic back pain for 10 years managed with Tylenol and Advil. He reports decreased sensation in his feet over the years but notes only a dull ache in the affected ankle area. He has a known penicillin allergy, manifesting as facial bloating and difficulty breathing as a child. His surgical history includes sinus surgery in his teens for sinusitis.

6,"A 45-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of a painful, swollen, and red lesion on his right ankle, which he initially described as a ""rash"" but clarified as more painful than rash-like. The patient reports the lesion appeared approximately one week ago, with pain developing yesterday. He describes the area as swollen, increasingly red, and ""meaner"" in appearance. He notes the presence of scabs, which he admits to scratching, and one of these scabs has since opened, leaking a ""white stuff"" (suggestive of purulent discharge) since the swelling began. The pain is exacerbated by walking and flexing the ankle but is relieved at rest. He reports feeling ""hot"" for the past 12 hours, and subjectively notes his right leg feels hotter than his left. He has also experienced a general feeling of being ""crummy"" for the last couple of weeks, with decreased energy today, increased hunger, and tiredness, which he attributes to stress and potentially poorly controlled diabetes. He denies difficulty breathing or chest pain. While he has a history of occasional diabetic ulcers and minor foot trauma due to poor foot care, he states this specific presentation is ""strange looking"" and unlike anything he has experienced before, though he does have a currently ""doing alright"" ulcer on his left heel. His past medical history is significant for poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, with a last known A1C of approximately 9, for which he takes three oral medications (including Metformin and an unnamed ""Sidas...something""), but is not on insulin and has stopped regularly monitoring his blood sugars. He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, for which he takes Rosuvastatin, childhood asthma (currently asymptomatic), and chronic back pain for 10 years managed with Tylenol and Advil. He reports decreased sensation in his feet over the years but notes only a dull ache in the affected ankle area. He has a known penicillin allergy, manifesting as facial bloating and difficulty breathing as a child. His surgical history includes sinus surgery in his teens for sinusitis. Socially, he is a 45-year-old unemployed accountant, partially self-employed, living in town and seeing his children every two weeks.

8,"A female patient presents to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Her history of present illness details an insidious onset of sharp, localized pain in the right upper quadrant, just below the lungs, approximately three days prior, occurring 30-60 minutes after lunch. The pain has progressively worsened, becoming significantly more severe in the last 3-4 hours before presentation, now rated 8/10 in intensity. It does not radiate and remains confined to the right upper quadrant. She reports associated nausea over the past few days, which is worse today, but denies any vomiting, blood in emesis, skin changes, rashes, changes in urinary habits (dysuria, color changes), or changes in bowel patterns (diarrhea, color changes, blood in stool). Her energy levels are decreased today due to the pain, and her appetite is also significantly reduced today, though it was previously normal. Over-the-counter Advil and Tylenol provided no significant relief. She recalls a similar episode of pain a few years ago that resolved spontaneously without medical intervention. Her past medical history is largely unremarkable, with no known drug allergies, no prescribed medications (though she occasionally takes over-the-counter antacids a couple of times a month for heartburn), and no prior surgeries or hospitalizations other than for childbirth. She has been advised by her doctor to lose weight. Socially, she works as a bank consultant, lives with her two children and partner in a supportive home environment, denies recent travel or sick contacts, is a non-smoker, and denies recreational drug use. She consumes 1-2 glasses of wine nightly but denies any issues with her alcohol intake.

Five days prior to symptom onset, she ate rice with chicken Manchurian at a new Chinese restaurant; her friend who accompanied her did not consume the same dish. She has attempted to manage her symptoms by drinking plenty of water to prevent dehydration but has not taken any over-the-counter medications. She has also been eating less, particularly since the onset of abdominal cramps yesterday. She denies recent travel or contact with sick individuals. Her past medical history is significant for asthma, for which she uses puffers, and she denies any known allergies or prior digestive issues. She underwent wisdom teeth removal in the past but was not hospitalized for it. Socially, she is a student living with two roommates, consumes 1-2 glasses of alcohol on weekends, and denies smoking or illicit substance use. Her typical diet includes oatmeal for breakfast, a quick lunch like a salad, and eating out for dinner, often a burger or fries. Family history reveals her brother had appendicitis when he was young, and her mother had a hysterectomy, but there is no other family history of digestive or abdominal problems.","Haanji, main aapke parivaar mein digestive ya pet se judi kisi bhi samasya, ya pet ki surgery ke baare mein poochhna chahta tha.","मेरे भाई को बचपन में अपेंडिसाइटिस हुआ था, और मेरी माँ का हिस्टेरेक्टॉमी (गर्भाशय निकालने का ऑपरेशन) हुआ है, अगर यह गिना जाता है।"
11,"A six-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. His mother reports that the abdominal pain began approximately three days prior to presentation, initially causing irritability, and is described as a generalized ""stomach ache"" located centrally, without specific tenderness on palpation. Two days prior to presentation, he developed vomiting, occurring a total of six times over the past two days; the first day's emesis contained food material after lunch, while yesterday's was described as yellowish, non-bilious, and non-bloody, occurring randomly after the initial episode. Concurrently, he developed watery diarrhea, with approximately six to seven episodes in the last day, also noted to be non-bloody. Yesterday, he developed a fever, measured at 38.3°C, accompanied by chills requiring multiple blankets, and exhibited significant lethargy, sleeping most of the day. He denies headaches, ear pain, eye pain, eye redness, runny nose, sore throat, dysphagia, anosmia, ageusia, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, chest pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, rashes, muscle aches, or joint pains. His diet has consisted strictly of home-cooked meals with no recent changes. He is a generally healthy child with no prior medical diagnoses, hospitalizations, or surgeries. His immunizations are up to date, and he has no known allergies or regular medications. Developmental milestones are met, and he performs well in school. Birth history is unremarkable, with a normal vaginal delivery at 39 weeks, an estimated birth weight of 3 kg, and normal Apgar scores.

12,"A male patient, whose age is not specified but is a working production overseer and has two children, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of worsening abdominal pain over the past three days. The patient reports an insidious onset of symptoms approximately five days prior, initially experiencing vague crampy sensations and bloating, which he attributed to constipation. His bowel habits, previously regular at once daily, shifted to constipation five days ago, with his last bowel movement occurring two days prior to presentation. The pain significantly intensified three days ago, localizing primarily to the right lower quadrant, near the right hip and inferior to the umbilicus, occasionally radiating slightly superior to the umbilicus but predominantly remaining in the right lower side. He describes the pain as progressively worsening, aggravated by palpation and a single episode of vomiting ""the other day,"" which he found particularly distressing due to the associated bodily contractions. Resting flat provides minimal relief. Associated symptoms include nausea and a subjective sensation of feeling ""a bit hot"" recently, though no temperature was recorded.

13,"A 30-year-old female, who works at a bank in London, presents with a chief complaint of suspected bladder infection, experiencing dysuria and increased urinary frequency for the past couple of days. She describes a burning or stinging sensation upon urination, which she notes has ""maybe a little bit"" worsened since onset, and an exacerbation of her baseline frequent urination, which typically occurs every 30-60 minutes due to a history of overactive bladder. She reports her urine has appeared ""a little cloudy"" but denies hematuria, frothy urine, or foul odor. Associated symptoms include feeling tired and a subjective sensation of being ""a little hot"" yesterday, without a measured fever, and her mother noted she looked ""a little flushed."" She denies any back pain, flank pain, vaginal lesions, or concerns for sexually transmitted infections, noting she has not been sexually active for several years. She also denies any perianal numbness, changes in bowel movements, peripheral edema, periorbital puffiness, or facial rashes. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent urinary tract infections, with the most recent episode occurring approximately three months ago, which resolved with antibiotics.

He reports stepping on an object, causing his right ankle to twist inwards. Immediately post-injury, the pain was mild, allowing him to complete his run and walk home. However, the pain progressively worsened over a few hours and has remained constant since. The pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the right ankle, with some radiation to the sole of the foot, and is described as dull and achy. It is aggravated by ankle movement and standing, and alleviated by rest. He denies any associated bruising, redness, swelling, skin changes, fever, chills, weakness, numbness, or tingling. He is able to bear weight for short periods and ambulate, though with pain, and can move his ankle slightly. His past medical history is notable for a similar ankle twist during childhood while playing basketball and a recent episode of diarrhea treated with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic a few months prior. He currently takes Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and other unspecified vitamins, and reports no known allergies, prior hospitalizations, or surgeries. Socially, he is a non-smoker, denies recreational drug use, and consumes alcohol infrequently (a glass of wine once every couple of months). He is actively training for a race, maintaining stable weight. His family history includes osteoarthritis in his grandparents and gout in his father.","Chinta mat karo, hum aapka physical check-up karenge taaki fracture na ho, aur agar yeh sirf ankle sprain hai, toh hum ise immobilize karke ice lagane aur Advil jaisi dawa lene ki salah denge, jisse yeh khud hi theek ho jayega, aur baad mein physiotherapy bhi kar sakte hain, lekin agar zyada dard hua toh X-ray bhi karna pad sakta hai.","ठीक है, यह अच्छा लग रहा है, धन्यवाद।"
17,"A 40-year-old right-handed female presents with a chief complaint of right lateral elbow pain, which she first noticed several months ago with insidious onset and no specific trigger or trauma. The pain has been progressively worsening over this period, currently rated as a 4/10 on a pain scale. She describes the pain as primarily achy, with sharp exacerbations depending on movement. Aggravating factors include repetitive wrist movements, particularly wrist extension, picking up or holding heavy objects, and repetitive tasks associated with her occupation on an assembly line. The pain is alleviated by rest, over-the-counter analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and topical ointments, which provide some relief. The pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the right elbow and does not radiate. She denies any associated redness, swelling, warmth, misalignment, skin changes, deformities, numbness, tingling, or cold sensation in the affected arm. Furthermore, she reports no systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fever, chills, fatigue, rashes, changes in senses, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, changes in bowel or urinary habits, memory loss, or confusion. Despite the pain, she maintains full range of motion in her right elbow and hand and has been able to manage daily tasks and work, though the pain is increasingly becoming an issue with her job duties. On physical examination, there is tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect of the right elbow, but no tenderness medially, in the forearm, or biceps. Pain is elicited with wrist extension and wrist flexion when the elbow is in full extension, but not with elbow flexion, shoulder extension or abduction, or forearm pronation and supination. Her past medical history is notable only for a non-emergency C-section 17 years prior; she reports being otherwise healthy with no other hospitalizations or surgeries, is up to date on immunizations, and has no known allergies. Current medications include only acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for pain. Socially, she works on an assembly line, consumes alcohol occasionally (one glass of wine per week), has never smoked, denies marijuana use, has had no recent sick contacts or travel. Her family history is negative for any skeletal, muscular, neurological, or autoimmune conditions.",Aapko kya takleef hai?,"नमस्ते, मुझे पिछले कुछ महीनों से दाहिनी कोहनी के बाहरी हिस्से में दर्द हो रहा है, जो हाल ही में और बढ़ गया है।"

17,"A 40-year-old right-handed female presents with a chief complaint of right lateral elbow pain, which she first noticed several months ago with insidious onset and no specific trigger or trauma. The pain has been progressively worsening over this period, currently rated as a 4/10 on a pain scale. She describes the pain as primarily achy, with sharp exacerbations depending on movement. Aggravating factors include repetitive wrist movements, particularly wrist extension, picking up or holding heavy objects, and repetitive tasks associated with her occupation on an assembly line.

20,"A 17-year-old male, currently in his last year of Grade 12, presents with a chief complaint of acute right knee pain, redness, and swelling, which began two days prior following a direct kick to the medial aspect of his right knee during a soccer game. The pain, described as sharp and rated 5/10 in severity, has remained constant or slightly worsened since the injury.
